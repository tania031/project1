<h1>Programming language</h1>
<p> Programming languages are used to control the performance of the computer or machine. 
    At present, computer programmer has many choices to choose the language, but there 
    are many differences between programming languages.

        <br><h6><p>Procedural Programming Language</p></h6>
        <p>The procedural programming language is used to execute a sequence of statements
             which lead to a result. Typically, this type of programming language uses 
             multiple variables, heavy loops and other elements, which separates them from functional 
             programming languages. Functions of procedural language may control variables, other than
              function’s value  returns. For example, printing out information.</p>

        <h3>Type 2</h3>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">button2</button><br>
        <br><h6><p>Functional programming language </p></h6>
        <p>Functional programming language typically uses stored data, frequently avoiding 
        loops in favor of recursive functions.The functional programing’s  primary focus
         is on the return values of functions, and side effects and different suggests that
        storing state are powerfully discouraged. For example, in an exceedingly pure useful
        language, if a function is termed, it’s expected that the function not modify or perform 
        any o/p. It may, however, build algorithmic calls and alter the parameters of these calls. 
        Functional languages are usually easier and build it easier to figure on abstract issues.

        <br><h6><p>Object-oriented Programming Language</p></h6>
        <p>This programming language  views the world as a group of objects
         that have internal data and external accessing parts of that data. 
         The aim this programming language  is to think about the fault by separating
          it into a collection of objects that offer services which can be used to solve 
          a specific problem. One of the main principle of object oriented programming language
            is encapsulation that everything an object will need must be inside of the object.
